# The OpenCV Camera Library 

**Simple open-source library for effortlessly grabbing frames from a sensor.**

Once Initialised with the correct attributes (or none at all if you like) the library will:

> Use Multi-threading to avoid blocking operations on your program, and ensure that a frame is always accessible 
> Noise Reduction - on new frames before they are passed back 
> Frame flipping - Ne frames can be flipped in their orientation, useful for mirror effects


##TODO
> Increase the effeciency on noise reduction as it can be pretty unsuable on fluid videos
> Add Call and Run support - essentially be able to just call the library and have it work out which port the camera is on
